# UDM Reimbursement Project ðŸš€
The reimbursement system project at Detroit Mercyâ€™s College of Engineering and Science aims to make the reimbursement process simpler and more efficient for faculty members within the college. This innovative system provides a user-friendly platform that allows faculty to create, manage, and submit reimbursement requests quickly. It also makes it easier to track expenses related to academic activities and events, while ensuring compliance with institutional policies and financial regulations. The system, which is built on a solid technical foundation, uses technologies such as Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to provide a seamless and secure experience. The proposed reimbursement system project brings together technology, efficiency, and user-centric design to improve financial management processes within the university, creating a more productive and accountable academic environment.

### Known limitations
We are currently running a free-instance of Render (the service we use to host backend). Because of this, the server sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity, so if the initial load time of the website is long, it's not broken (usually), and will have normal loading times after the initial load
